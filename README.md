# Nes Emulator
This project was made in Rust and emulates the Nintendo Entertainment System including the CPU(MOS Technology 6502) and PPU.

At the moment, the MOS 6502 CPU and most of the PPU is complete. Background and Sprite data can be loaded and displayed, however no input nor scrolling is implemented(yet).
## Running the Emulator
To run, look inside `main.rs` and enter the path of the `.nes` file to run. Then, run `cargo run` to run the application.
