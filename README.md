# Nes Emulator
This project was made in Rust and emulates the Nintendo Entertainment System including the CPU(MOS Technology 6502), PPU, and APU.

At the moment, the MOS 6502 CPU is complete. Running this specific version of the repository can let the user play a game of Snake from this cpu.

This is currently a work in progress and may encounter bugs.
